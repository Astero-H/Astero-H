* 🔗 You will find my personal website at [hamid-hennane.fr](https://hamid-hennane.fr) <br><br>

My name is Hamid, an IT Professional Developer, Consultant and Entrepreneur. 
As a web application developer, I specialize in the PHP language and its ecosystem, and provide efficient and scalable PHP-based solutions for modern dynamic web applications.

I am always on the lookout for new ideas and challenges in the field of web and coding in general. 
Currently residing in Spain, I have spent a significant part of my life in Europe. <br><br>
I graduated in 2019 with a professional degree in computer development. I dove into the world of IT programming as early as 2014, 
after obtaining my DUT (University Diploma of Technology) in computer science. <br><br> My journey has led me to explore a wide range of technologies, 
thanks to my diverse experiences in companies from different backgrounds, including software publishing, public service, and private digital services companies.
